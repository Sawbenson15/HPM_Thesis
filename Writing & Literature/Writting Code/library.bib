   abstract = {The hedonic pricing theory suggests that house is a differentiated commodity, whose value depends on its heterogeneous characteristics. Application of the theory has been well implemented using OLS Regression. Our study investigates this econometric concept using machine learning algorithms. An improved pricing will benefit buyers, sellers, investors, banks and real estate professionals. Normality test for the experiment was done using Chi-Square Quantile-Quantile plot and Henze-Zirkler's Multivariate Normality Test. Statistical relationship was based on correlation matrix, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin and Bartlett tests. Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Principal Component Regression (PCR) were used as learning algorithms. Performance comparison of the learning algorithms was done using spearman's rho correlation coefficient. The performance of the model showed that PCR has a slight edge over SVR and K-NN. Also, the study validated the suitability and substitutability of PCR, SVR and K-NN in the implementation of the hedonic pricing theory.},

2020 was a remarkable year for the housing market. Strong demand drove intense competition among buyers, causing homes to fly off the market at the fastest pace Zillow has recorded and pushing prices higher. Housing demand was already strong coming into the year with the large Millennial generation aging into prime first-time home-buying age and mortgage rates hovering near record lows. The widespread shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted many to reevaluate their housing options and supercharged demand. },

@article{AsiaGreen,
   abstract = {For residential real estate, the basic logic behind the co-integration of GDP growth and real estate capital returns arises from the fact that income has to be accumulated to buy a home. Income, in turn, can be directly derived from GDP with only a few adjustments. Studies in Asia, Europe, and the US reveal that median home prices correlate by as much as 60% to 95% with GDP per capita.  In the long run the growth trends of both cycles typically correspond to each other. However, high correlation between GDP and real estate prices might not be given at all points in time. The prevalent real estate cycles do not always mirror GDP cycles, but often follow their own pattern. In the short and medium term real estate dynamics are not just driven by a country's prosperity and depend on other determinants. These are, for example, urbanization rates, construction activity and demographical changes which all influence supply and demand temporarily.},

   abstract = {<p>Endowment effect refers to the reported gaps between willingness to accept and willingness to pay. According to prospect theory, this effect is a result of the underweighting of opportunity costs. Given the high stake involved in a typical housing transaction, endowment effect is expected to have a significant influence on housing decisions. We develop a theoretical framework to study the presence of endowment effect and its role in housing decision-making process. Three hypotheses are derived and tested through a field experiment conducted in Beijing, China. Our empirical results show that endowment effect plays an important role in the formation of judgmental biases in housing decisions. Moreover, endowment effect interacts with housing cycles. Our study highlights the application of prospect theory in the housing market; thus, it not only extends existing theoretical and empirical works in this important sector, but also clarifies consumer behavior in the emerging property market of China.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Due to the forced changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had in many aspects of ordinary life (working, social life, training and learning in schools etc.), the characteristics of domestic spaces have significantly modified buying, selling and renting decisions in the real estate market. The aim of this research was to structure a methodology, articulated into four steps, to assess the variation that has occurred in residential market demand as a result of COVID-19 anti-contagion measures, with regard to six metropolitan Italian cities. We considered two samples of properties for each city, the first referencing the pre-COVID-19 pandemic spread and the second collected in the current situation. Consequently, we were able to determine variations in residential market appreciations through the application of a regressive econometric technique. The obtained results highlighted the relevance assumed by indoor acoustic and thermal comfort property factors, compared with the pre-COVID-19 condition. The proposed methodology could be useful to support the public and private entities involved in urban investment decision-making processes, allowing us to identify the most appreciated factors of the residential real estate market demand, in order to improve the conditions of existing and future assets and reduce the related risk levels.</p>},
